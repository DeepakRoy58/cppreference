# C++ Reference Learning

This repository contains my personal notes, code snippets, and practice programs as I learn C++ from the official documentation at [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/).

## 📚 Source of Learning
I am referring to the [C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/) website to deepen my understanding of modern C++ concepts, including:

- Syntax and semantics
- STL (Standard Template Library)
- Algorithms and containers
- Language features (C++11/14/17/20/23)
- Templates, memory management, and more

## 📂 Folder Structure

cppreference/
├── primitives.cpp
├── ... (more files coming soon)
└── README.md


## 🚀 Goal

To build a strong foundation in C++ and master topics required for:
- High-performance programming
- Competitive programming
- System-level development
